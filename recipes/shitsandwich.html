    Classic Shit Sandwich New York Deli Style
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 piece anemic white bread (WonderBread is perfect)</li>
        <li>Grass-fed butter (I try to buy organic)</li>
        <li>Shit*</li> 
    </ul>
    <div class=note>*I personally prefer fresh shit over the canned stuff because canned shit usually has a stale, metallic taste and/or a
     slightly sour aroma which gets in the way of appreciating such a simple dish. 
    So, when available, try to source some fresh shit. It's worth it, I promise.</div>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Take your two piece of bread and lay them side by side</li>
        <li>Butter both liberally</li>
        <li>Smear the fresh shit on one piece of bread, then the other. Don't overstuff it even though it's tempting to do so!
            The last thing we want is our shit sandwich to fall apart. </li>
        <li>Bon appetit!</li>
    </ol>
